#   HOMEWORK  Data Table Coding
#   Instructions:  Submit an Rmarkdown file and a Word file that shows all
#                  required code and output.

# 1
# Use data.table coding to read in data from the College Data excel spread
# sheet.  Assign the data imported to the variable CollegeData

CollegeData <- fread("Collegedata.csv")    # 4 points
CollegeData

# 2
# Now use tidyverse coding to read in the College Data excel spread sheet.
# Assign the imported data to the variable CollegeDatatd


CollegeDatatd <- read_csv("Collegedata.csv")  #  4 points
CollegeDatatd


# 3
# Use R coding (of your choice) to determine how many rows and columns the
# College Data table has.  (Answers may Vary)

dim(CollegeData)    # 4 points


# 4
# Use data.table coding to select the variables INSTNM, SAT_AVG, and ADM_RATE.

CollegeData[, .(INSTNM, SAT_AVG,ADM_RATE)]    # 6 points



# 5
# Use tidyverse/dplyr coding to select the variables INSTNM, SAT_AVG, and
# ADM_RATE.

CollegeDatatd%>%
  select(INSTNM,SAT_AVG,ADM_RATE)           # 6 points


# 6
# Use data.table coding and the CollegeData data table to only show data for
# institutions for schools that have admission rates that are less than 
# 20 percent and SAT averages that are greater than 1500. Your data.table
# output should show five institutions that satisfy these conditions.


CollegeData[ADM_RATE < .20 & SAT_AVG > 1500]   # 6 points


# 7
# Use data.table coding to show observational data (values for all 12 variables
# for American University. In particular, what is the admission rate and 
# SAT average for American University.

CollegeData[INSTNM == "American University"]     # 6 points


# 8
# For the CollegeData data frame, Use and show data.table coding that will 
# produce the first fifteen observational rows, the column variable AGE_ENTRY
# ordered from highest.  Also, your table only has the column variables INSTNM
# AND AGE_ENTRY. Assign your coding to the variable fifteen. The table produced
# is provided below;

CollegeData[1:15][order(-AGE_ENTRY)][, list(INSTNM,AGE_ENTRY)]-> fifteen
fifteen                  # 8 points


# 9
# Now using R coding of your choice, find the minimum,maximum, 1st and 3rd
# quartiles, the mean, and the median for the variable AGE_ENTRY.
# Make sure that AGE_ENTRY is defined as numeric.  Convert the variable to
# numeric if needed.

summary(as.double(fifteen$AGE_ENTRY))    # 4 points


# 10
# For the CollegeDatatd data frame, Use and show tidyverse/dplyr coding that
# will produce fifteen observational rows. Your table should only have data for
# the variables INSTNM and AGE_ENTRY.  Also, the column variable AGE_ENTRY 
# is to be ordered from highest to lowest. Your table result should be the
# same as for # 8.


CollegeDatatd%>%
  slice(1:15)%>%
  select(INSTNM,AGE_ENTRY)%>%
  mutate(AGE_ENTRY = as.double(AGE_ENTRY))%>%          
  arrange(desc(AGE_ENTRY))                        # 8 points
